# Dog vs. Cat Classification using CNN

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Dog vs. Cat Classification Model** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The model is trained to distinguish between images of cats and dogs with high accuracy. This is a fundamental deep learning task widely used in computer vision applications.

## ✨ Features
- 🐶🐱 **Classifies images as either a dog or a cat.**
- 🤖 **Utilizes CNNs for feature extraction and classification.**
- 📊 **Evaluates performance using accuracy and loss metrics.**
- 🔄 **Applies data augmentation for better generalization.**

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images of:
- **Dogs** 🐶
- **Cats** 🐱

Each image is:
- **Resized** to `224x224` pixels.
- **Normalized** for consistent pixel values.
- **Augmented** to improve model performance.

## 🛠 Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python scikit-learn
```

## 🏗 Model Architecture
- **CNN-based Model:** Uses multiple convolutional layers followed by dense layers.
- **Activation Function:** Softmax for binary classification.
- **Loss Function:** Binary Cross-Entropy.
- **Optimizer:** Adam optimizer for better performance.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training Process
1. 📥 **Load & preprocess the dataset.**
2. 🔄 **Apply data augmentation techniques.**
3. 🏗 **Build and train the CNN model.**
4. 🎯 **Evaluate the model using validation data.**
5. 📊 **Visualize training accuracy & loss.**

## 🚀 Usage
To run the model, execute the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Dog_vs_Cat_Classification.ipynb
```

## 📈 Results
The model achieves **high accuracy** in classifying dogs and cats. Performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- 🎥 **Implement real-time classification using OpenCV.**
- 🏗 **Experiment with pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet, or EfficientNet.**
- 🚀 **Optimize model performance with hyperparameter tuning.**
